###Cesium Docset for Dash

[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager for Mac OS X. This package is a docset that can be imported into Dash to provide quick and easy searching and navigation of the Cesium documentation offline.

Dash also provides a dynamic workflow for searching your downloaded docsets via [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com), Launchbar, and has integration for many other tools as well. These two together make searching the Cesium documentation lightning fast.

The current docset is auto generated so I'll maintaining it every month when new updates come out for Cesium. The docset contains links and searching for all class objects, their members, and their methods.
